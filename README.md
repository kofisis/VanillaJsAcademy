# VanillaJsAcademy Projects
A series of projects I did when taking part in the Vanilla JS Academy

### Toggle Password Visibility
A simple login form that reveals password once the "show password" toggle is clicked
When a user clicks the `#show-password` checkbox, the `#password` field should display the password in plain text if the box is checked, or mask it if itâ€™s not.
